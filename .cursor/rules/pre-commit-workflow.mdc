# Pre-Commit Workflow

Mandatory checklist to be performed before every commit:

**Note**: For testing Inngest workflows, use `npm run dev:all` to run both Next.js and Inngest dev servers together.

1. **Validation**: 
   - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` (Type Check) to ensure no TypeScript errors
   - Run `npm run lint` to ensure no linting errors

2. **Database**: 
   - Run `npm run db:validate` to ensure connectivity.

3. **Ingestion**: 
   - Run `npm run ingest:validate` to validate Reddit ingestion service functionality.

4. **LLM Service**: 
   - Run `npm run llm:validate` to validate LLM extraction and ideation service functionality.

5. **Workflow**: 
   - Run `npm run workflow:test` to validate Inngest workflow pipeline functionality.

6. **Audit**: 
   - Update `.cursor/PROMPTS.md` with the key prompt used to generate the feature

7. **History**: 
   - Export the chat history to `.cursor/history/` and link it in the `PROMPTS.md` entry
